Implement your criminal and student strategies in `criminal.py` and `student.py` respectively. Ensure that your criminal strategy inherits `BaseCriminal` and that your student strategy inherits `BaseStudent`.

Modify game parameters (e.g. which students, which criminals to play) in `game.py` at the bottom of the file (under `if __name__ == "__main__":`).
